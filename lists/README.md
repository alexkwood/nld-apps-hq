A proof of content using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) with [Socket.io](http://socket.io).

## Use case
A family goes to the mall together with a list of things to buy.
As they shop, they think of new things to add to the list.
Each person doesn't know what the others have bought.
So they use an **interactive shopping list** to keep everyone in sync!

## How to use
Run as a node.js app, `node app.js`. Then each user connects to the server's URL at port 3000.

## Demo
If it happens to be up at the moment, try http://node.newleafdigital.com:3000. (No guarantee that it will stay live.)
